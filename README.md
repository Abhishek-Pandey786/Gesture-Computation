Maths Gesture Using AI
A Python-based application that recognizes hand gestures to interpret and solve mathematical expressions using Artificial Intelligence. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to provide an interactive and intuitive way of solving mathematical problems through gestures.

üîç Overview
The "Maths Gesture Using AI" project combines gesture recognition and mathematical computation to create a hands-free interface for solving math expressions. Users can draw numbers and operators in the air with their hands, and the application interprets the gestures, performs the calculation, and displays the result in real-time.

üöÄ Features
Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detects and recognizes hand gestures using a webcam.
Mathematical Expression Parsing: Converts gestures into mathematical expressions.
AI-Powered Recognition: Uses deep learning models to classify gestures accurately.
Interactive Visualization: Displays recognized gestures and computed results dynamically.
Multi-Operator Support: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Provides feedback for unrecognized gestures or invalid inputs.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools:
OpenCV: For real-time video processing and gesture detection.
MediaPipe: For hand tracking and keypoint detection.
TensorFlow/Keras: For training and deploying the gesture recognition model.
NumPy: For mathematical operations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and debugging.

üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
Hand Detection:

MediaPipe captures and tracks the user's hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
Gesture Recognition:

A trained machine learning model classifies the hand gestures into predefined categories (digits and operators).
Expression Solving:

The recognized gestures are combined into a mathematical expression and evaluated.
Result Display:

The computed result is displayed on the screen in real-time.
