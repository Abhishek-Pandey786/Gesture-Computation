# Gesture-Computation
A Python-based AI application that uses computer vision to recognize hand gestures and solve mathematical expressions in real-time. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow, this project interprets gestures as numbers and operators, parses mathematical expressions, and displays results dynamically.
